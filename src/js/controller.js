/**
 * The MVC Architecture
 * It is important to know how to implement an architecture by yourself before using a framework
 * The state is basically what stores all the data about the application that is running on the browser i.e. the data
 *  from the application's frontend basically.
 *  Stores data you might fetch from an API, data the the user inputs, etc.
 *  This data should be the single source of truth which should be kept in sync with the UI. Which means if some data
 *    changed in the state then the UI should reflect that and vice versa.
 * Storing and displaying data and keeping everything in sync is one of the most difficult tasks when building web
 *  applications that why there are many state management library like Redux or Mobx.
 * MVC = Model View Controller
 * One of the big goals of the MVC Architecture is to actually seperate business logic from application logic and the
 *  controller will connect them.
 * The Model and the controlle just sit there waiting to get some instructions from the controller.
 * Note that there are actually different ways of implementing the MVC pattern where some are more complex than others.
 */

/**
 * Refactoring for MVC
 * We will have a multiple view --one for each feature
 * It important to keep in mind that an async function will return a promise that we then need to handle whenever we
 *  call that async function if we want to get a result out of it or if we want to stop the execution in the function
 *  that is calling the other async function.
 * window.location returns the whole url
 */

/**
 * Helpers and Configuration Files
 * Many real world applications have 2 special modules that are completely independent from the rest of the architecture
 *  - Helper Functions/Files
 *    The goal of this file is to contain a couple of functions that we will reuse in our project.
 *  - Configuration Files
 *    Will have all variables which should be constants and will be reused across the project
 *    You do not want to put all the variables here in this file, the only variables you put are the ones that are
 *    responsible for defining some important data about the application itself.
 * Using uppercase for a variable that will not change is common practice in a configuration file.
 * Use 'throw' to propagate the error down from one async function to the other by rethrowing the error in the catch
 *  block.
 */

/**
 * Event Handlers in MVC: Publisher-Subscriber Pattern
 * In the way we set up the architecture, the view does not know anything about the controller so it doesn't import
 *  the controller and so we can't call any of the functions that are in the controller from the view.
 * Design Patterns in programming are standard solutions to certain kinds of problems.
 * WATCH LECTURE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS PATTERN!!!

 * .nodeValue() will return null for everything except for Text

/**
